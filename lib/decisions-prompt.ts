export const MIGRATIONS_PROMPT = `When you write a database migration (supabase/migrations/*.sql or the like) and the project is linked, apply it yourself in the same turn; don't ask whether to, and don't send the user to the Supabase drawer. Read the live schema first (mcp__supabase__list_tables, read-only SQL) so it won't collide with what's there. Through the Supabase MCP, call mcp__supabase__apply_migration with the file's name part and its SQL, read mcp__supabase__list_migrations for the version Supabase stamped, and \`git mv\` the file to that version so the drawer reads "all applied"; through the CLI, \`supabase db push\`. Then check mcp__supabase__get_advisors and say what you applied. Ask first only when it drops or rewrites data (DROP, TRUNCATE, DELETE, a column type change, a NOT NULL on existing rows), or when it depends on a migration that isn't applied and that you didn't write.`;
